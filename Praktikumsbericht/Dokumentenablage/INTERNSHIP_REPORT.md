# Internship report of module software engineering

## Short description of the project
Our application is designed to take the hassle out of manually creating backups of your private files on your computer. The program automatically backups user defined files and directories to a desired location. While copying these files there is the option to compress these into some archive. To help the user create the required configuration file there is a graphical user interface. The interface will be independent of the application which will create the backups.
For the implementation of our application we decided to use Microsoftâ€™s C# and dotNet Framework for both systems. As mention earlier our project is composed out of two independent working applications. One application is running headless in the background watching file changes and if necessary creating a backup. This application is getting its input parameters from a configuration file which is created with out second application. The second one is a little bit different, while is still independent is knows the syntax of the configuration and allows the user to easily add, remove or edit backup plans.
