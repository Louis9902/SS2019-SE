```

### Prerequisites
To fully render the UML diagrams you need to have [Graphviz][2] installed as well as plant [PlantUML][3].
To render the diagrams just open the jar file which you have downloaded from PlantUML and navigate to the correct folder. 
Then you can choose which diagram you want to see. Please note this won't work if you don't have [Graphviz][2] installed.
There is also an alternative for the browser called [PlantText][4], this site should be self-explanatory.
